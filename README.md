Simple application developed using: pseudoMVVM pattern + Retrofit + Coroutines

This project aims to:
- create an app using the benefits of ViewModels without getting tied to DataBinding.
- settle the foundations for a scalable architecture.
- treat views as objects that observe ViewModel's attributes (values and ViewStates) and react to them in a concise way.
- experiment the SharedViewModel feature.

And overall, experiment, learn and discuss about different technologies and different approaches!
